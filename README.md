# Flood-prediction-and-management-system
FloodSOS is a project that utilizes machine learning to predict flood intensity and identify areas with critical needs during flood events. By analyzing various data sources,
it aims to:

Forecast Flood Severity: Predict the intensity of upcoming floods to provide lead time for preparation and response.
Pinpoint Critical Locations: Identify areas with the highest risk and locate people who require immediate life-saving services.
Facilitate Effective Response: Deliver real-time alerts and insights to emergency responders and residents, enabling swift and coordinated action.

This project strives to improve flood preparedness and response, ultimately saving lives and minimizing flood damage.
